# Griffin Linux – The Smartest Way to Switch from Windows **Coming soon in 2026.**

**Griffin Linux** is a user-friendly, gaming-ready Linux distribution designed for Windows users who want a familiar desktop, powerful performance, and intelligent assistance — without the ads, telemetry, or bloat of modern Windows.

Built on the rock-solid **Linux Mint (Ubuntu LTS)** foundation and available in three rebranded editions:

- **Griffin Linux Cinnamon** – Flagship edition with the classic Windows-like taskbar and menu.
- **Griffin Linux XFCE** – Lightweight and fast, perfect for older hardware.
- **Griffin Linux KDE** – Modern Windows 11-style experience with advanced customization.

All editions include the full **Griffin tool suite** — GUIs and automations that make Linux feel effortless.

Whether you're gaming on the latest RTX hardware, migrating your files and projects, or just browsing — Griffin Linux makes the switch **simple, smart, and powerful**.
